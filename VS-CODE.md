### <p align="center">Features of VS-CODE</p>
##### 1-Make it your own
Customize every feature to your liking and install any number of third-party extensions. While most scenarios work "out of the box" with no configuration, VS Code also grows with you, and we encourage you to optimize your experience to suit your unique needs. VS Code is an open source project so you can also contribute to the growing and vibrant community on GitHub.
##### 2-Always-On IntelliSense
You wouldn’t want to be writing .NET code without the comforts of Visual Studio IntelliSense, right? VS Code knows this and tries to please with out-of-the-box cdproject (from a CDN) and then adding the icons themselves. The extension supports over 20 popular icon sets, including Font Awesome, Ionicons, Glyphicons, and Material Design Icons. 
##### 3- Huge Language Support
Not only is VS Code available cross-platform, it aims to be your one-stop code editor with support for 30+ programming languages out-of-the-box. Which ones you ask? You get to write C#, VB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby, Objective-C, PHP, JSON, Less, Sass and Markdown, just to name a few. You get built-in syntax highlighting and bracket matching in your code, as well as easy code navigation. VS Code aims to be a first class IDE of choice for Node.js, ASP.NET and TypeScript development, aimed at modern web/cloud applications.
##### 4- Function Parameters
One of the nifty IntelliSense features of VS Code is helping out with typed function parameters during corresponding invocation, thus allowing easy code completion. This obviously works with programming language/system functions, but is also smart enough to offer help on custom functions that you have in your code. As the screenshot below demonstrates, function invocation offers up typed parameters, if VS Code sees the function definition elsewhere in the project
##### 5- Always-On IntelliSense
You wouldn’t want to be writing .NET code without the comforts of Visual Studio IntelliSense, right? VS Code knows this and tries to please with out-of-the-box IntelliSense. Sure you get friendly prompts on language features, but also smart IntelliSense that is local context aware in your custom code.
